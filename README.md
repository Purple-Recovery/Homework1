### Problem Statement
Right now, the University of Washington’s official responses, resources, and statistics are scattered (via department, college, etc). This can pose problems to students as they might need to do a lot of searching and jumping around different webpages, emails, and social media posts. The UW’s “COVID-19 Landing Page” (found here: https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/) currently aims to provide a one stop shop, although it is not as comprehensive as it could be. This seems to be missing: university buildings’ hours, resources that are staying open, lack of RSO information, and where to turn for academic support. Further, it is quite text-heavy, and the interface for the FAQs is in a list view. 

### Our Mission 
Purple Recovery is focused on allowing University of Washington students to achieve the best outcome of their quarantined quarters. As we've talked about above, the necessary resources are out there and it is a matter of bringing such information together for ease of access. Our mission is to provide UW students with a range of resources during the COVID-19 outbreak. This will help to combat and ease their abrupt transition to distance learning, increased time indoors, and less social contact.
